1. What are Bitwise Algorithms ?

Bitwise algorithms are used to manipulate and operate by performing efficient operations on binary numbers, such as integers, at the bit level. These algorithms use bitwise operators, such as AND, OR, XOR, and shift operators, to manipulate the bits of a binary number and to perform operations like setting, clearing and toggling bits etc to extract information from the data.


These algorithms uses the binary representation of data and use the fundamental bitwise operations such as AND, OR, XOR, NOT, and bit shifting to manipulate and 

2. Why Bitwise Algorithms are important ?

These algorithms are importent becouse they can be used to:
* Optimize code: Bitwise algorithms can be used to reduce the number of operations required to perform a task, making the code more efficient.
* Improve performance: Bitwise algorithms can be used to take advantage of the hardware's ability to perform bitwise operations quickly, resulting in improved performance.
* Reduce memory usage: Bitwise algorithms can be used to pack multiple values into a single binary number, reducing memory usage.

3. What are the common bitwise operators ?
The common bitwise operators are as follows 
* Bitwise AND (&): Performs a binary AND operation on two integers, bit by bit.

Example: 5 & 3 = 1 (Binary: 101 & 011 = 001)

* Bitwise OR (|): Performs a binary OR operation on two integers, bit by bit.

Example: 5 | 3 = 7 (Binary: 101 | 011 = 111)

* Bitwise XOR (^): Performs a binary XOR operation on two integers, bit by bit.

Example: 5 ^ 3 = 6 (Binary: 101 ^ 011 = 110)

* Bitwise NOT (~): Performs a binary NOT operation on an integer, bit by bit.

Example: ~5 = -6 (Binary: ~00000101 = 11111010)

* Left Shift (<<): Shifts the bits of an integer to the left and fills 0 on voids left as a result.

Example: 5 << 1 = 10 (Binary: 00000101 << 1 = 00001010)

* Right Shift (>>): Shifts the bits of an integer to the right and fills 0 on voids left as a result.

Example: 10 >> 1 = 5 (Binary: 00001010 >> 1 = 00000101)
